SELECT DISTINCT p.type, l.model, l.speed
FROM Laptop l, Product p
WHERE p.model = l.model AND
      l.speed < (SELECT MIN(speed) FROM PC);


29) Under the assumption that receipts of money (inc) and payouts (out) are registered not more than once a day for each collection point [i.e. the primary key consists of (point, date)], write a query displaying cash flow data (point, date, income, expense).Use Income_o and Outcome_o tables

SELECT i.point, i.date, i.inc, o.out
FROM Income_o i LEFT JOIN Outcome_o o
ON i.point = o.point
AND i.date = o.date

UNION
SELECT o.point, o.date, i.inc, o.out
FROM Outcome_o o LEFT JOIN Income_o i
ON o.point = i.point
AND o.date = i.date ;


41) For each maker who has models at least in one of the tables PC, Laptop, or Printer, determine the maximum price for his products.
Output: maker; if there are NULL values among the prices for the products of a given maker, display NULL for this maker, otherwise, the maximum price.

SELECT maker,
  CASE 
    WHEN sum(CASE 
                WHEN price IS NULL THEN 1 
                ELSE 0 
             END) > 0 THEN NULL
    ELSE max(price) 
  END AS price
FROM(SELECT p.maker,pc.price
FROM product p, pc
WHERE p.model = pc.model
UNION ALL
SELECT p.maker,l.price
FROM product p, laptop l
WHERE p.model = l.model
UNION ALL
SELECT p.maker,pr.price
FROM product p, Printer pr
WHERE p.model = pr.model
) res
